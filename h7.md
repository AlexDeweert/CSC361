## Concepts
- Port Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
- Sockets and Port numbers
- Checksum
- TCP Sequence and acknowledgement Numbers



## Q1
Consider a `TCP` connection between host `A` and host `B`. Suppose that the `TCP` segments traveling from `A` to `B` have source port number `x` and destination port number `y`. What are the source and destination port numbers for the segments traveling from `B` to `A`?

> For segments traveling from B ==> A:<br>
> Source = y<br>
> Dest = x







## Q2
Suppose a process on host `C` has a `UDP` socket with port number `6789`. Support both host `A` and host `B` each send a `UDP` segment to host `C` with destination port number `6789`. Will both of these segments be directed to the same socket at host C? If so, how will the process at host C know that these two segments from two different hosts?

> Yes they will be directed to the same socket. If the receiving process (on Host C) is programmed to unpack the header information then host C unpacks the segment and datagram and identifies the source via source IP and port number. Otherwise, the process will not know who the segment came from.





## Q3
`UDP` and `TCP` use 1's complement for their checksums. Suppose you have the following three 8-bit bytes: 01010011, 01100110, 01110100. What is the 1's complement of the sum of these 3 bytes. (Note: although `UDP` and `TCP` use 16-bit word sum, we are only computing with 8-bit for this problem.) Show all steps.





1. Why is it that `UDP` takes the 1s complement of the sum? Why not just use the sum instead?


> Speed. Although it's possible for the destination to simply compare a sum sent from the source to it's own calculation of the sum, this is slow. <br>

> If the source sends only the sum (instead of checksum) then the destination will have to do a bit-by-bit comparison of it's own sum, and the original sum. <br>

> Using checksum, the destination adds the words and the checksum value (sum + checksum) and can check if the result is 1111 1111 much faster than a bit-by-bit comparison. CPUs are optimized to conduct 1s complement on a string of ones, and can determine if the result is zero or not very quickly.





2. With the 1s complement scheme, how does the receiver detect checksum errors?

> The receiver calculates word1 + word 2 + ... + checksum. If the result is all ones, then there is no error.






## Q4
Host `A` and `B` are communicating over a `TCP` connection, and host `B` has already received from `A` all bytes up through byte 126 inclusively. Suppose host `A` then sends two segments to host `B` back-to-back. The first and second segments contain 80 and 40 bytes of data respectively. In the first segment, the sequence number is 127, the source port number is 302, and the destination port number is 80. Host `B` sends an acknowledgement whenever it receives a segment from `A`.

1. In the second segment sent from A to B, what are the sequence number, source port number, and destination port number?



> Second segment: <br>
> Sequence# = 207 <br>
> SourcePort = 302 <br>
> DestPort = 80




2. If the first segment arrives before the second segment, in the acknowledgement of the first arriving segment, what is the acknowledgement number, the source port number, and the destination port number?


> Acknowledgement:<br>
> Ack# = 207<br>
> SourcePort = 80<br>
> DestPort = 302<br>





3. If the second segment arrives before the first segment at `B`, in the acknowledgement of the first arriving segment (i.e., the second segment), what is the acknowledgement number?


> This depends on the protocol being used:<br>
> With Go-Back-N, the acknowledgement number is 126 (it replies with the last consecutive segment received)
> With Selective-Repeat, the acknowledgement number is 246, since thats the last byte it has received (bytes 207 to 246 in the second segment).






4. Suppose the two segments sent by `A` arrive in order at `B`. The first acknowledgement is lost and second acknowledgement arrives after the first timeout interval at `A`. Draw a timing diagram (Message Sequence Chart), showing these segments and all other segments and acknowledgement sent. For each segment in your figure, provide the sequence number, the number of bytes of data; for each acknowledgement that you add, provide the acknowledgement number.
