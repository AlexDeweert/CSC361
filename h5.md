# Howework 5 (DNS)

Answer the following questions in the space provided. Submit your answers (a modified version of this file) as an attachment to the submission box. Consult the file **2.Wireshark_DNS_v7.0.pdf** if needed.

## Concepts
  - How DNS is organized?
  - What are the **resource records** maintained by each DNS server?
  - How to search DNS servers?
  - How to use `dig` and `nslookup`.
  - How DNS queries and resource recorded are transmitted?


## DNS and `dig` Tool
`dig` is a UNIX utility that can interact with DNS servers. We will use `dig` to explore the DNS domain hierarchy. (Read [Dig Command Examples](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/02/dig-command-examples/) for some examples.)
Start `CSC361-VM`. Open a terminal and enter the command:

    $ dig

This will request from your local namer server the list of all **root** name servers.

Q1. How many **root** name servers? What are they?
> 13 root name servers
> a.root-servers.net
> b.root-servers.net
> c.root-servers.net
> d.root-servers.net
> e.root-servers.net
> f.root-servers.net
> g.root-servers.net
> h.root-servers.net
> i.root-servers.net
> j.root-servers.net
> k.root-servers.net
> l.root-servers.net
> m.root-servers.net

Q2. What is the IP address of the **name server** that provides these answers?
> 192.168.122.1
>
>

Enter the following shell command:

    $ dig NS ca

which requests from your local name server a list of all the name servers responsible for the `.ca` domain.


Q3. How many such name servers? What are they?
> 4 name servers
> c.ca-servers.ca
> x.ca-servers.ca
> j.ca-servers.ca
> any.ca-servers.ca

Enter the following shell command:

    $ dig @m.root-servers.net NS ca


which requests from one of the **root** name server a list of all the name servers responsible for the `.ca` domain.

Q4. Does this list look exactly the same as the answers in Q3?
> Not exactly. It contains the same list under the AUTHORITY section, however it contains duplicate info under ADDITIONAL plus the IPV6 data.
>
>

We are going to **iteratively** investigate all the domain name servers in the DNS hierarchy. Our target hostname is `www.csc.uvic.ca`. There are several domains or subdomains in this hostname, i.e., `.ca`, `.uvic.ca`, `.csc.uvic.ca`.

Enter the following shell command

    $ dig NS ca

which will list all name servers responsible for the `.ca` domain.

Q3. What are they? (The same question as Q3.)
> Exactly the same results as the first question 3 (see above Q3 - this seems like a mistake)
> 
>

Now, take one of those listed name servers and enter:

    $ dig @<one of the named servers> NS uvic.ca

Essentially, we are asking one of the `.ca` root name servers all the namer servers responsible for `.uvic.ca` domain.


Q5. What the registered name servers responsible for `uvic.ca`? How many? What are there?
> 4 name servers 
> ns4.uvic.ca
> ns5.uvic.ca
> dns1.uvic.ca
> dns2.uvic.ca

Now, repeat the command for `csc.uvic.ca` domain by asking one of the name servers in Q5.

    $ dig @<one of the named servers> NS csc.uvic.ca

Q6. What the registered name servers responsible for `csc.uvic.ca`? How many? What are there?
> 4 name servers
> ns4.uvic.ca
> ns5.uvic.ca
> dns1.uvic.ca
> dns2.uvic.ca


Q7. List all the mail servers for google.com.
> alt2.aspmx.l.google.com 
> alt1.aspmx.l.google.com
> alt4.aspmx.l.google.com
> alt3.aspmx.l.google.com
> aspmx.l.google.com

Q8. List all DNS record types about "uvic.ca", including A, AAAA, TXT, MX and NS.
> A                142.104.197.120
> AAAA             <none>
> TXT              AfxlqgTTJLAIveEAncnfWICR6Rgr6sJgezPgDwrHP7U=
> TXT              google-site-verification=Ho7KjuRFxgLp5rCvp4SeC-E2zCcPTaqaYzwqQyyMgaY
> MX               smtpz.uvic.ca
> MX               smtpy.uvic.ca
> MX               smtpw.uvic.ca
> MX               smtpv.uvic.ca
> MX               smtpu.uvic.ca
> MX               smtps.uvic.ca
> MX               smtpr.uvic.ca
## DNS and `nslookup` Tool

    nslookup www.ncu.edu.tw

Q9. Run `nslookup` to obtain the IP address of  `www.ncu.edu.tw`. What is the IP address of this web server?
> 140.115.17.82 
>
>

    nslookup â€“type=NS ncu.edu.tw

Q10. Run `nslookup` to determine the authoritative DNS servers for `ncu.edu.tw`. What are they?
> dns2.ncu.edu.tw
> dns.ncu.edu.tw
>

    nslookup www.ncu.edu.tw <one of the name servers in Q10>

Q11. Run `nslookup` to one of the DNS servers obtained in last Question. What are the answers? Compare it against Q9.
> dns2.ncu.edu.tw
> 140.115.1.33#53
> The first value is the same. The second value is an IP not a domain name.


    nslookup -type=MX yahoo.com

Q12. Query the mail servers for `yahoo.com` and `yahoo.ca`. What are the results?
> (same for both .ca and .com)
> mta5.am0.yahoodns.net
> mta6.am0.yahoodns.net
> mta7.am0.yahoodns.net


## UDP and DNS
Now, we should use Wireshark to investigate what were sent from your computer when you use `dig` or `nslookup`.
- Start `CSC361-VM`.
- Open a terminal session.
- Flush your DNS cache. (Read [How To Flush Your DNS Cache](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214981288-Flushing-your-DNS-cache-in-Mac-OS-X-and-Linux)).
- Start Wireshark with a capture filter `ip.addr == your_IP_address`.
- In your terminal, enter the `dig` or `nslookup` commands that you did earlier Q1 to Q3.
- Stop Wireshark but don't close.

Q13. Locate the DNS query and response messages. Are then sent over UDP or TCP?
> UDP
>
>

Q14. What is the destination port for the DNS query message? What is the source port of DNS response message?
> Destination Port for Query: 53
> Source Port for Response: 43348
>

Q15. To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Compare it to Q1. Are these two IP addresses the same?
> 192.168.122.1
> This is the same address as the name server in Q2
>

Q16. Examine the DNS **query** message. What `Type` of DNS query is it? Does the query message contain any _answers_?
> Recursive query. Zero answers.
>
>

Q17. Examine the DNS **response** message. How many _answers_ are provided? What do each of these answers contain? (For example, answers in Q1.)
> 12 answers.
